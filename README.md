# moench-configs
Use this config in case of external use of the MOENCH detector when the detector is connected to the workstation with its own router.

## Important information
Please note that configs might be identical with `sxr-lab` branch. The reason is that the router was configured in a most similar way (almost simulating the lab) to avoid any problems with moench workstation network profiles. However, it does not imply that the configs will be identical. Therefore, there is a dedicated branch to not interfere with the original configuration.
